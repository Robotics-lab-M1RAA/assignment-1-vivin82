1. ROS nodes : Launch ROS core and carry out the following tasks

(a) List the currently running nodes

/rosout

(b) What is the purpose of node /rosout

The /rosout node is used to log messages from nodes and is used to display them in a single stream.
 
(c) List the currently running topics

/rosout
/rosout_agg

(d) What topics are subscribed by the node /rosout

Subscriptions: 
 * /rosout [unknown type]

(e) What topics are published by the node /rosout

Publications: 
 * /rosout_agg [rosgraph_msgs/Log]

(f) What are the services provided by the node /rosout

Services: 
 * /rosout/get_loggers
 * /rosout/set_logger_level

(g) Kill the node /rosout and again list the running nodes. What is your observation.

killing /rosout
killed
/rosout
/rosout cannot be terminated unless we exit from roscore.

(h) What are the functions of commands cleanup, info, kill, list, machine &
ping of the rosnode command-line tool

        rosnode ping	 test connectivity to node
	rosnode list	 list active nodes
	rosnode info	 print information about node
	rosnode machine list nodes running on a particular machine or list machines
	rosnode kill	 kill a running node
	rosnode cleanup purge registration information of unreachable nodes

2. ROS publisher node : Create a ROS publisher node with the following features.
Node name : '<your first name_pubnode'
Topic published : 'Greetings'
Message : 'Hello, I am <your first name>'
Message type : std_msgs_String
Rate of publishing message : 10 Hz
Use rospy.loginfo to echo the message published on to the terminal

(b) Launch rqt_graph. Save its screenshot as question2_rqt1.png Comment on your
observations from rqt_graph.

	Only 1 node is running and it is directly communicating with /rosout because the subscriber code has not been executed.

3. ROS subscriber node : Create a ROS subscriber with the name 'RAA24_subnode'
that subscribes to the topic 'Greetings'

(b) Run rqt_graph and save the screenshot as question3_rqt1.png. Comment on your
observations from rqt_graph.

	The node vivin_node1 is communicating directly with rosout and the subscriber code RAA24_subnode.

4. ROS publisher-subscriber node Realize the ROS nodes and messages as shown in the
figure 1 below

(a) List the currently running nodes

/CET_18181_1729680419745
/M1RAA_24_26_18112_1729680412722
/Vivin_18039_1729680393439
/rosout

(b) List the currently running topics

/Hello_class
/Welcome
/hello_college
/rosout
/rosout_agg

(c) What is the role of the node rosout

rosout gives us the output from all the 3 nodes that are currently running.

(d) Change the name of node 2 to 'M1RAA 2024' and rerun the code. Write down any
error message displayed.
